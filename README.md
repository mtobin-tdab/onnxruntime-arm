# onnxruntime-arm

This repository is a build pipeline for producing a Python wheel for [onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/) for ARM32 / 32-bit ARM / armhf / ARM.

Whilst this is intended for use with [pi-top's Python SDK](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-Python-SDK/), it should be suitable for anyone looking to use onnxruntime with Python on a Raspberry Pi.
